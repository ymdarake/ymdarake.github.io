## Hello from Docusaurus
This is the first blog post with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). (ver `2.2.0`)

<!-- truncate -->

It's quite easy to write document, posts and etc with Docusaurus, so I decided to use it also for my own website.

_(If you're thinking of writing UMLs with PlantUML in Docusaurus, you should know Docusaurus, as of now, uses PlantUML's public API to render UML images.)_

I like how intuitive it is to organize markdown (and other) files to build a website with it.

Previously I used [zola](https://www.getzola.org/), which is not so bad but a bit awkward to customize and build...

But now I'm in a positive mood to post my reading notes or misc thoughts here.
