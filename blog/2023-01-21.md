## Hiüëã How you doin'?

When I text somebody, I write something like this at the beginning.

Do you do this too sometimes?

I like to use emojis as punctuation characters, pretty much.

## WEB input validation

So, what if you have to check the length of a message like that?

I know that I gotta be careful about stuff like `.length`, `input[0]` and so on,

but this time, I stepped in further into the internals.

### Let's count string length in JavaScript

<!-- truncate -->

If you want to make sure users receive an error message when they input too many characters, you may write:

```js
const input = "some random input";
if (input.length > 30) {
    alert("sorry, your profile must be less than 30 characters!");
}
```

But what exactly is the `input.length` counting? In the example above,
```js
> const input = "some random input"; console.log(input.length);

17
```

Yeah, looks no problem. But hey, what if your user write something like:
```js
> const input = "Hiüëã How you doin'?"; console.log(input.length);

19

> "üëã".length

2

// ok, I know it's a multibyte character, that's fine ofc.
// let's try another lovely sentence
> const input = "I love my girlfriendüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®"; console.log(input.length);

31

// huh, this is getting wild...

> "üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®".length
11

// ok, fair enough...?
```

Hmm, OK I know something happens with emojis, but why?

### Internal representation of string in JavaScript

When you write JavaScript code, I assume you set the encoding to `UTF-8`.

But JavaScript uses `UTF-16` in its internal representation of strings.

First of all, when you use `UTF-16` you have to represent a character in 2 bytes, _not alaways but pretty much_.

So, as you know, it's like `A is U+0041`, 4 digits of hex, ok it's 2 bytes.

If you want to check Unicode table, you refer to https://unicode.org/charts/

But let's think about it, how many characters can we deal with in this way?

Yes, it's 2 bytes, which means 2^16 = 65535.

Is that enough? _No._

So if you want to use _minor_ characters like üëã, you have to use `Surrogates`,

roughly meaning you have to treat `2 characters as 1 character`.

OK, then what is the Unicode code point of üëã? Let's check at https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%91%8B/ (emojipedia comes in hady)

So üëã's code point is `U+1F44B`. (Is that `codepoints` btw? Help from English speakers wanted...)

As you've noticed, `U+1F44B` is 5 digits of hex and over 65535,

with that pointed out, in JavaScript (UTF-16):

```js
> "üëã".split("")

(2)¬†['\uD83D', '\uDC4B']
```

Voila! (?)

[Hight Surrogates 'U+D83D'](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+D83D) + [Low Surrogates 'U+DC48'](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+DC48)

become 1 character with power, or cost, of 2 characters. What a story!

### Zero Width Joiner

Next, what about üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®? Isn't it weird that its `.length` is 11??

Let's unpack, or split it:

```js
> "üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®".split("")

(11)¬†['\uD83D', '\uDC69', '‚Äç', '‚ù§', 'Ô∏è', '‚Äç', '\uD83D', '\uDC8B', '‚Äç', '\uD83D', '\uDC68']
```

It looks something like `emoji + empty char + heart + empty char + empty char + emoji + empty char + emoji`.

You want more organized information? Look here! https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%91%A9%E2%80%8D%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%92%8B%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%91%A8/

It says `Codepoints	U+1F469, U+200D, U+2764, U+FE0F, U+200D, U+1F48B, U+200D, U+1F468`.

Given `U+1F469` is equivalent to `U+D83D + U+DC69`, `U+200D` is the one of _empty char_.


What is this?

Let's take a look at https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+200D this time.

Ah, your name is `Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ)`, nice to _SEE_ you finally.

Another _empty char_ is `U+FE0F Variation Selector-16 (VS16)`: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+FE0F

You can read its detail [at Unicode org's website](http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucd/StandardizedVariants.html) but, in short,

with `U+2665 U+FE0E` you get black heart, while with `U+2665 U+FE0F` you get red heart.

OK, that's it for today. Cool!

I hope it was clear, and hopefully not wrong at least. (correction welcomed!üôè)
