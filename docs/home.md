**Hello, I'm [ymdarake](https://github.com/ymdarake)**.

## What I do

### 1. Software Engineering
I've been working as a software engineer for about 8 years.

Have built web services, enterprise applications and like so.

Futher information is on [Now page](./now).

### 2. Farming
I'm interested in farming, and have done 'tiny' farming in my backyard.

These days, I've been wanting to try bush craft and bumboo craft.

## Where I have been in/to
